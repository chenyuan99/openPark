# openPark: an open source software which allows to find parking slot


## Introduction

openparking is an open source software which allows to find parking slot

## Publication

In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scaleimage recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depthusing an architecture with VGG(Simonyan et al, 2014) and ResNet(Kaiming et al., 2015) on the prior-artconfigurations that can be achieved by pushing the depth of the number of layers.We also show that our representations generalize well to other datasets, where they achievestate-of-the-art results. Our code is available on https://github.com/fw21/COMP576to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.
